        Decorating a cake is sort of like solving a puzzle.  There are numerous pieces that have to come together, just so, for everything to align beautifully.  The process itself can be exciting, challenging and even a little exasperating at times.  But when the last piece is finally placed, you can step back and smile at what you’ve accomplished.  So today we’re taking a look at some of the basic fundamentals of a gorgeous cake.  These building blocks apply to cakes of all shapes and sizes and will help you create beautiful cakes, each and every time you bake.</p>

        It all comes to us from the new book, Great Cake Decorating, written by our very own contributor, Erin Gardner of Wild Orchid Baking Co.  Erin has been wowing us with her stylish designs and teaching us her techniques for several years now.  So needless to say, we are thrilled to see her new book out in stores for all to enjoy!  Filled with hundreds of creative ideas, tips, and techniques, Erin’s book has something for everyone.  Beginners will find what they need to get started with recipes, tools of the trade, and the basics thoroughly explained and paired with gorgeous images by Mark Davidson Photography.  More advanced decorators will find inspiration and step-by-step tutorials to create countless designs including some of Erin’s most popular cakes here on the blog, like her Rainbow Hearts Cake and her Stars and Stripes Cake originally create for our 4th of July cake series back in 2012.  If you ever wondered how Erin created that beautifully swagged bunting, now you can learn how.  Within the pages of Great Cake Decorating, Erin is helping us solve the cake decorating puzzle.  And today, we’re excited to share a little peek inside this new book!

        “The best decorating idea in the world will be lost on your guests if they are distracted by a cake that is lopsided, lumpy, or bulging at the sides.  Take time to build a great cake base, and decorating will be so much easier.  For simplicity’s sake, the cakes shown are baked in round pans, but the level-and-split method words for any cake shape.”
